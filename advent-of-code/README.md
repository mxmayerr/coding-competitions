My (quick-thought-of and not optimized) solutions to Advent of Code problems. 

FOR 2022: Solutions are written in a main aoa.java file and are ran using a runner, which you can be anything you want. Solutions sometimes include part 1 and 2, but sometimes only part 2. 

If there aren't comments regarding part 1/part 2, assume solution is for part 2 - and you can edit to get part 1.
