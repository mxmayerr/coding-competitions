## Running My Code

Most of the code is written in java, but if in python, you may need to install dependencies. In proper directory, run

```bash
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

This is only needed for a python file if it includes a requirements.txt file in the directory and you don't already have the libraries.

**Beware of helper classes** which you must make sure are in the proper folder.
